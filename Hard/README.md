For the test, the code is available on this [github](https://github.com/Mayank85Y/Chat) page. I have created the package [chat](https://github.com/Mayank85Y/Chat) as per required in test.

If you wish to see my package R package development skills, I highly recommand you to go through the [probTools](https://github.com/Mayank85Y/probTools) whose code is available on [github](https://github.com/Mayank85Y/probTools). I have done proper testing and documentattion of this package. I do wished to do same for this package but GSoC deadline is pretty near so i focused on function mainly.
